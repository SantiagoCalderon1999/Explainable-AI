# Explainable AI with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in Python and JupyterLab

## Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) is a crucial area in the field of artificial intelligence, aiming to provide transparency and interpretability to machine learning models. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) algorithm is a powerful tool for explaining model predictions. This project explores the use of SHAP in Python, primarily within JupyterLab.
